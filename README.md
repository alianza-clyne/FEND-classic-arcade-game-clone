## Welcome To The Game!
----------------------------------------------
Welcome to my Classic Arcade Game! Now, here's all the details you need to know.

In this game you have a Player (you) and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down.

The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene so you better watch out and put those keyboard fingers to work!

Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square.

Once the player reaches the water the game is won. Give yourself a big pat on the back---you did it!
